title: COMP3207 - Introduction to Python - A Basic Tutorial
---

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have installed Python 3 as in the [prerequisites](prerequisites.html). These teaching materials are optimised for Linux and Mac, but should also work on Windows (taking into account the differences, in particular, with the command line).

Download the tutorial materials by going to [https://github.com/steve-crouch/COMP3207-python-basics](https://github.com/steve-crouch/COMP3207-python-basics) and selecting `Code` and `Download ZIP`. Unpack the contents to a directory within your home directory. Using a terminal or command prompt, change directory to the `COMP3207-python-basics-gh-pages/code` directory. This will be our working directory for the material.
