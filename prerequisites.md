**If you wish to code along with the material, you'll need to install some software on your laptop**


## Help!

We maintain a list of common problems that can occur during installation and ways of solving them. Take a look at the [Configuration Problems and Solutions wiki page](https://github.com/swcarpentry/workshop-template/wiki/Configuration-Problems-and-Solutions) for help.


## Text Editor

A text editor is the piece of software you use to view and write code. If you have a preferred text editor, please use it. If you don&#39;t have one, we recommend the following.

#### Windows

[Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v6.9.2.html). Just download the installer and run it.

#### Mac OS X and Linux

Nano is a text editor that is installed by default on Mac OS X and Linux.

You can verify you have nano installed by opening a terminal and entering:</p>

~~~ {.code}
nano
~~~

If nano is not installed, you will receive an error. If it is installed, nano will open (appearing not dissimilar to the terminal window, but with menu items at the bottom of the window).

To exit nano press CTRL+X (you might be prompted you to save or discard modified buffer - just type "N" to exit without saving).


## Python

We use Python 2.7 for this introduction, as it's required to use the Google App Engine.

The "Python Anaconda" installation provides everything Python-related you will need for the workshop. To install Anaconda, go to the link below and install version 2.7 (not 3.5!) - scroll down the page a bit for the link:
